## Processsing ECMWF data with Python

Sometimes, just visulisation is not good enough. Users need to retrieve/access and process data. For 30 years now ECMWF provide a high-level tool to access Forecast and observation data in formast stored in MARS archive at ECMWF: GRIB, BUFR and ODB. In recent years the NetCDF support was much approved.

The notebooks in this folder show you how you can use the metview-python interface to access/process & visulise meteorological data.
